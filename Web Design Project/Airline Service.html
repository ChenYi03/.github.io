	<h1>Airline Service Course Information</h1>
	<h2>About Crescendo's Diploma in Airline Service</h2>
	<p>This programme is specifically designed for those who wish to build a successful career in the airline service industry (or in any service-related industry in general). It is the first diploma in airline services in Malaysia and is tailored to bridge the gap between academic learning and the vocational skills urgently required by the current industry. Students of the programme will be rigorously trained to achieve a level of professionalism in cabin crewing that is on par with international standards.</p>

	<h2>Course Highlights</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>A Practical-oriented Programme - Students are taught on textbook theories and given a hands-on training on how to put those theories to practice so they would know exactly how to apply them in the real situations. Essential soft skills such as interpersonal, leadership, communication, and adaptability as a cabin crew professional are also incorporated into the training.</li>
		<li>Multilingual Communication Skills - We believe that the ability to communicate effectively with clients in various languages has become a necessity in this era of globalization. Our students are taught to be proficient in several international languages like Korean, Japanese, Mandarin and English, so they would have a competitive edge to stand out from the crowd.</li>
		<li>The Highest Standards of Customer Service - Cabin crews are considered one of the elites in the service industry. Their ability to provide good services that keep their passengers safe, comfortable, happy are always expected of them wherever they go. Students of our programme are trained to adopt the highest standards of practice that would make them valuable to a wide range of service related careers.</li>
		<li>A Foretaste of The Cabin Crewing Experience - Aviation knowledge and cabin crewing experience are not only imparted to students in the classroom, they are also integrated into their daily routines. Students are required to wear their uniform and practice full grooming on their daily basis, conduct practical aviation services, and obey rules and regulations set by their own aviation industry for cabin crews.</li>
